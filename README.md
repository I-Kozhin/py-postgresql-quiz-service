# Quiz Service with PostgreSQL

This Python-based project provides a web service for a quiz application, leveraging PostgreSQL for data storage. The service fetches random quiz questions from a public API and stores them in a PostgreSQL database.

## Features

- Accepts POST requests with a JSON payload specifying the number of questions to retrieve.
- Fetches the requested number of random quiz questions from a public API.
- Stores the questions and their details in a PostgreSQL database.
- Ensures uniqueness of questions in the database.
- Returns the previously saved question as a response for subsequent requests.
- Supports data persistence using Docker volumes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd quiz-service-postgresql
   
3. Build the Docker image and start the containers:
    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    docker-compose -p test-db -f docker-compose.yml up postgres-db
   
4. The service should now be running on http://localhost:8000. You can access the API using your preferred API testing tool (e.g., curl, Postman).

## API Usage
Send a POST request to http://localhost:8000/questions with the following JSON payload to retrieve quiz questions:

    {
    "questions_num": 5
    }

The response will contain the previously saved quiz questions, if available.
